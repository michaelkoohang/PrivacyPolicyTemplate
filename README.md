# Privacy Policy Template

## About 

This is a template for creating a privacy policy for any website, app, or software you might develop. It's important to be transparent and honest in your privacy policy, so be diligent when writing yours.

### Information We Collect

At the heart of your website’s privacy policy is a disclosure of what data you collect from users. Some common types of data that you’ll find in website privacy policy templates are:

* Personal data (like names and email addresses)
* Derivative data (like IP addresses and browser types)
* Financial data (like credit card details)
* Social network data (like Facebook login information)
* Mobile data (like mobile device IDs and manufacturers)
* Third-party data (like social network friends lists)

Both the GDPR and CCPA state that privacy policies should disclose what types of information a website collects. The above are only some basic examples of what types of information may mean for your site.

### Why We Collect Information

Another legal necessity under various privacy laws, your data collection needs an explicit purpose — and that purpose needs to be written out in your privacy policy.

Here are just a few examples of ways you may use the user data you collect:

* To send marketing materials or newsletters
* To process orders
* To complete transactions
* To enter users in sweepstakes, contests, or surveys
* To create and maintain user accounts
* To prevent fraudulent activities

If you engage in any of the above activities — or others that require the collection of data — you need to list them in your privacy policy.

### Data Discloure to Third Parties

It’s not uncommon for a website to be integrated with other sites and services. For example, nearly 30 million live websites use Google Analytics. Given this online ecosystem, it’s only to be expected that your website might need to transfer data to third parties to operate smoothly.

To stay compliant with the law and maintain a transparent privacy policy, you must disclose the categories of third parties with whom your site may share information. Some common categories of third parties include:

* Service providers
* Ad vendors & networks (like Google Adsense)
* Social networks
* Business partners
* Affiliates
* Other site users

Along with which categories of third parties you may share information with, you should note the purposes behind the data exchange.

### Your Rights Over Your Data

Your privacy policy should have a section outlining what rights users have over their data, and how they can act on those rights.

For example, users from the EEA or California have the right to request access to data that has been collected about them. Specify this right in your privacy policy, including instructions on making such requests.

### Links to Other Policies

Many sites label their network of legal policies collectively as their “Terms.” Your site’s terms will most likely include a privacy policy, terms of use, and disclaimer.
